# Ubuntu 
Ubuntu is a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots. All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME since version 17.10. 
  
  
  Ubuntu is developed by British company **Canonical**, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release,starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated  **end-of-life (EOL) date**. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from those who download the Ubuntu software. Ubuntu is named after the **Nguni philosophy** of ubuntu, which Canonical indicates means "humanity to others" with a connotation of "I am what I am because of who we all are".*



## Background 
> Ubuntu is built on Debian's architecture and infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions. Ubuntu releases updated versions predictably every six months, and each release receives free support for nine monthThere commended system requirements are:s (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative, substantially beneficial low-risk bug fixes.    >The first release was in October 2004.
## Features
A default installation of Ubuntu contains a wide range of software that includes LibreOffice,Firefox,Thunderbird, Transmission, and several lightweight games such as Sudoku and Mines. Many additional software packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software (previously UbuntuSoftware Center) as well as any other APT-based package management tools. Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by default, such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still accessible in the repositories and installable by the main tool or by any other APT-based package management tool. Cross-distribution snap packages and flatpaks are also available,that both allow installing software, such as some of Microsoft's software, in most of the major Linux operating systems(such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and in Fedora). The default file manager is GNOME Files,formerly called Nautilus.
### Security
Ubuntu aims to be secure by default. User programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes. Polkit is also being widely implemented into the desktop. The recommended system requirements are:ftware into four domains to reflect differences in licensing and the degree of support available. Some unsupported applications receive updates from community members, but not from Canonical Ltd
